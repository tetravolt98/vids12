I'm a 30-year-old man, and I still live with my parents. Am I weird?
    
The question on everyone's mind - am I normal or not? Well, let me tell you a story that might put things into perspective. My name is Alex, by the way, and I've been in your shoes before.I grew up in a small apartment with my parents, just like you. We all shared a cozy living space, but it was more than just a roof over our heads - it was a sense of security and comfort. As a kid, I loved coming home to the smell of mom's cooking and dad's favorite oldies playing on the stereo.As I grew older, things started to change. My friends would often talk about moving out and starting their own lives, but for me, that wasn't an option yet. I had just finished college and was struggling to find a job in my field. My parents, being the understanding folks they are, offered me a place to stay while I got back on my feet.Fast-forward to today - I'm now 28, still living with my parents, but it's not because I'm avoiding responsibility. It's actually quite the opposite. With the rising costs of housing and living expenses in our city, it made sense for me to take some time to focus on my career before committing to a mortgage.You see, being "normal" is subjective, just like what happiness looks like to each person. Some people might think you're weird for still living with your parents, but others might understand that life is unpredictable and circumstances change. So, don't worry about it too much - focus on what makes you happy, and the rest will follow.What do you think? Have I convinced you that being a 30-year-old man living with his parents isn't weird at all?
