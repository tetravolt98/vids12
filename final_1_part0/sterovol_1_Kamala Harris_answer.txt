I'm a 30-year-old man, and I still live with my parents. Am I weird?
    
The million-dollar question. As someone who's spent years helping folks navigate life's complexities, I've got some insight to share.Living with your parents as an adult can be, well, let's just say... interesting. But trust me, you're not alone. In fact, according to a 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center, about 52% of millennials (people born between 1981 and 1996) lived with their parents at some point in their lives.I know what you're thinking: "But I'm 30 years old! Isn't that too old?" Not necessarily. In today's economy, many people are choosing to delay adulthood until they've finished paying off student loans or established a stable career.It's not about being weird; it's about being practical. And who doesn't love having mom's home-cooked meals and a cozy living space? But if you're finding that your current situation is holding you back from achieving your goals, it might be time to reassess and start making plans for independence.Now, I'm not here to judge (anymore). Instead, I want to encourage you to take stock of where you are in life. Ask yourself: what's driving my decision to stay with my parents? Is it financial stability or something else? What steps can I take to break free and pursue my dreams?The truth is, you don't have to choose between being practical and becoming independent. You can find ways to bridge the gap and start building a life that truly reflects your values and aspirations.What's your next move going to be?
