I'm a 30-year-old man, and I still live with my parents. Am I weird?
    
The infamous "man-child" conundrum. Let me tell you, I've been there too – well, not exactly, but I've guided many folks through similar situations.Growing up in Singapore, I moved back to India after completing my education and ended up living with my parents for a while. It wasn't by choice, mind you; it was more about transitioning into adulthood and finding the right job. Fast forward a few years, and I'm still not sure if I've fully escaped the "man-child" label.But here's the thing: being 30 and still living with your parents doesn't make you weird. It just means you're taking your time to figure things out – and that's perfectly normal. In today's world, where uncertainty and instability are the norm, it's not uncommon for people to take a little longer to get their lives together.In fact, research shows that nearly 30% of millennials in the US still live with their parents, often due to financial reasons or simply because they're taking time to pursue their passions. So, you're definitely not alone!What's more important is how you're using this time – are you learning new skills, networking, and making progress towards your goals? Or are you just coasting on the comfort of familiarity?As for me, I eventually moved out (with a decent job and a good income, might I add) and started building my own life. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it.So, take this as a friendly nudge: what's your next step going to be? Are you ready to take the leap towards independence? Or do you need some more time to get your ducks in a row?
