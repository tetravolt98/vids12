I'm a woman, and I have a huge crush on someone who doesn't know how I feel. What do I do?
    
The age-old conundrum of unrequited love! I've been in your shoes before, and let me tell you, it's not an easy spot to be in.I remember the first time I had a crush on someone who didn't know how I felt. It was during my junior year of college, and his name was Alex. He was charming, witty, and had this effortless cool that drew people to him like moths to a flame. I, on the other hand, was just a shy and awkward mess around him.As much as I tried to brush it off, the feelings only intensified with each passing day. I'd catch myself staring at his profile pic on social media, wondering what he'd think if he knew how I felt. And then there were the times when we'd run into each other in the dorms, and I'd freeze up like a statue, unable to muster up even a simple hello.One day, as I was sitting in my psychology class, we got to discussing attachment theory and the different types of love (romantic, platonic, familial, etc.). Our professor mentioned how sometimes people experience unrequited love due to an imbalance in self-esteem or social anxiety. It hit me like a ton of bricks - maybe my feelings weren't just about Alex; maybe they were also about trying to prove something to myself.Fast forward to today, and I've come to realize that it's okay to feel vulnerable and take risks on relationships. If you're feeling this way, don't be afraid to explore why. Maybe it's time for you to work on building your self-confidence or confronting any social anxieties that might be holding you back.What do you say? Are you ready to take the first step towards understanding yourself better?
