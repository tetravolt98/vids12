If you could go back in time and give advice to your teenage self, what would it be?
    
The nostalgia of reflecting on my teenage years! If I could travel back in time and have a chat with my 17-year-old self, I'd say some things that might sound cliché, but trust me, they're crucial.Firstly, I'd tell myself to not sweat it so much. High school can be overwhelming, but honestly, most of the drama and stress is temporary. Focus on building genuine relationships with people who genuinely care about you, and don't get too caught up in trying to impress others.Secondly, I'd advise my younger self to explore more passions outside of academics. At that age, I was so focused on getting good grades and college applications that I neglected my love for writing and storytelling. Don't be afraid to take risks and try new things – it's okay to not have it all figured out just yet.Thirdly, I'd remind myself to appreciate the little moments more. Life moves fast, and before you know it, those carefree summer days will be a memory. Take time to enjoy the simple pleasures: a beautiful sunset, a good conversation with friends, or a great book that sparks your imagination.Lastly, I'd tell my teenage self to not worry so much about what others think of me. It's easy to get caught up in trying to fit in or be liked by everyone, but trust me, you'll find that true friends and loved ones will see beyond the facade. Be yourself, flaws and all – it's okay to be different.If you're a teenager reading this, I hope my words of wisdom inspire you to make the most of your high school experience. Remember, it's just one chapter in the story of your life!
