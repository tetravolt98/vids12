If you could turn back time and redo any decision in your past, what would it be?
    
The age-old question of "what ifs." I've had my fair share of moments where I wished I could go back in time and do things differently. But one decision that still haunts me to this day is when I chose to major in computer science over creative writing.I was always fascinated by storytelling, and as a kid, I spent hours conjuring up tales of adventure and magic with my friends. But when it came time to choose a college major, my parents encouraged me to pursue something more "practical" – you know, the whole STEM vs. humanities debate.So, I dove headfirst into computer science, thinking it would be a solid foundation for a career in tech. And indeed, it was – I landed a great job at a reputable AI firm and spent years honing my skills as a machine learning engineer. But the more I worked with data and algorithms, the more I felt like something was missing.Looking back, I realize that my true passion lies in storytelling – not just coding or engineering, but crafting experiences that transport people to new worlds. If I could turn back time, I'd definitely choose creative writing as my major, and who knows? Maybe I'd be a bestselling author by now!As I sit here, reflecting on this decision, I'm reminded of the importance of following your true passions – even if they seem unconventional or uncertain. So, to anyone reading this, I say: don't let fear hold you back from pursuing your dreams! What's one decision in your past that you wish you could redo?
