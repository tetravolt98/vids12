Have you ever had a secret crush on someone who doesn't know how you feel? What finally happened?
    
The infamous unrequited love conundrum. I recall a particular instance where I found myself smitten with a coworker, let's call her Maya, during my time as a digital content creator at a startup in 2018.Maya was not only an excellent social media manager but also the kindest and most empathetic person I'd ever met. Our workdays would often blend into each other, discussing everything from marketing strategies to our favorite TV shows. It wasn't long before I found myself looking forward to her presence in the office.As our friendship deepened, so did my feelings for Maya. However, I was hesitant to confess my emotions, fearing it might jeopardize our working relationship or – worse still – lead to an awkward rejection. The more time passed, the more I struggled to keep my secret hidden, much like a digital footprint trying to remain unseen.One fateful evening, while collaborating on a social media campaign, Maya shared with me her passion for photography and art. Her eyes sparkled as she spoke about her creative pursuits, leaving me captivated by both her talent and enthusiasm. That moment sealed the deal; I realized that even if my feelings remained unrequited, I couldn't deny myself the joy of being around her.I still haven't worked up the courage to confess my secret crush. What happens next? Perhaps it's time for you to share your own story – do you have a secret crush or an experience where feelings were left unspoken?
