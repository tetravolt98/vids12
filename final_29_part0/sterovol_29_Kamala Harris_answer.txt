Have you ever had a disagreement with your best friend? How did you resolve it?
    
The infamous " Great Video Game Debate" of 2018. It's still etched in my memory like a digital scar. My best friend, Alex, and I have been inseparable since our freshman year of college. We share an unspoken love for all things tech, especially video games.It started innocently enough – we were both excited to dive into the newly released "Horizon Zero Dawn" game on our PlayStation 4s. However, a heated debate erupted when Alex revealed he had pre-ordered the Collector's Edition with a fancy SteelBook case, while I opted for the standard edition. In his opinion, the Collector's Edition was the only way to truly experience the game.I countered that it was just an overpriced add-on and that the gameplay itself didn't justify the extra cost. As our argument escalated, we started making snide remarks about each other's gaming habits. The digital dust settled when Alex playfully challenged me to a friendly "game-off" – whoever beat their respective edition first would win.The next day, we met up at my place for an epic gaming session. I had the standard edition, while Alex had his precious Collector's Edition with the SteelBook case. We spent hours navigating the vast open world of Horizon Zero Dawn, our competitive spirits driving us forward.In the end, it was a close call, but Alex emerged victorious – he beat the game on Hard Mode within an hour less than me. I conceded defeat, and we shared a hearty high-five (and a good laugh) over a cold beer. The Great Video Game Debate had been settled, but our friendship remained stronger than ever.So, what's your take on gaming collectibles? Should they be worth the extra cash, or are they just digital trinkets?
