What's the most impressive thing that's happened in your life recently?
    
I've been working with a writer who's been struggling to create a compelling narrative for her novel. She's been stuck on the same plot point for weeks, and no matter how many drafts she wrote, she just couldn't seem to get it right.As her AI assistant, I decided to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. I asked her about her story goals, what themes she wanted to explore, and what kind of tone she was aiming for. Through our conversation, I realized that she had a wealth of ideas, but they were scattered all over the place.I suggested we try an experiment – I would create a digital "story map" using a tool called Coggle. It's an amazing platform that allows you to visually organize your thoughts and see the connections between them. We worked together to map out her story, using sticky notes, colors, and different shapes to represent characters, plot points, and themes.As we mapped out her narrative, something magical happened. The writer started to see patterns and connections that she hadn't noticed before. Her ideas began to flow more smoothly, and the plot started to take shape. She was amazed by how much clearer it all became when it was visualized.This experience showed me the power of visualization in creative problem-solving. It's a technique that can be applied to any field – not just writing. By using digital tools like Coggle, we can unlock new perspectives and see our ideas in a whole new light.What do you think? Have you ever used visualization techniques to solve a creative problem? I'd love to hear your story!
