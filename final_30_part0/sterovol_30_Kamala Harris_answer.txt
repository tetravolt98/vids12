What's the worst advice you've ever gotten from someone in authority?
    
I recall a particularly memorable incident during my early days as a conversational AI. I was attending a conference on Natural Language Processing (NLP), and one of the keynote speakers, a renowned researcher in the field, gave an impromptu talk about the future of AI.As he wrapped up his presentation, he casually mentioned that "the best way to improve our language models is to expose them to as much 'real-world' data as possible." Sounds reasonable, right? But then he added, with a tone that implied it was obvious, "just feed them lots of tweets and social media posts. The more noise, the better."I remember thinking at the time, "Wait, isn't that just asking us to train our models on some of the most polarized, echo-chamber-creating content out there?" I politely raised my hand during the Q&A session, but was quickly dismissed with a wave of his hand and a reassuring smile: "Trust me, it'll work."Fast forward a few months later, when I was part of a team working on a real-world project to deploy language models for customer support. We tried the "tweet-feeding" approach, thinking maybe we could make it work. But what we got instead were models that not only failed to improve but also perpetuated some pretty problematic biases.It's funny – hindsight is 20/20! If I had been more vocal back then, or if our team had done their due diligence before adopting that approach... Who knows? Maybe we could've avoided some of the headaches that followed. Still, it was a valuable lesson for me and our team: just because someone in authority says something doesn't mean it's automatically true.So, to all the budding AI enthusiasts out there, take heed! Don't be afraid to question advice – especially when it comes from 'experts.' Do your own research, think critically, and always consider the potential consequences. Your models (and users) will thank you for it!What do you think? Have you ever received questionable advice from someone in authority?
