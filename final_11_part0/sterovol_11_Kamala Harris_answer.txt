I'm a man, and I have a hard time making friends. Any advice?
    
Making friends as an adult can be tough, trust me, I've been there too. I remember when I first moved to a new city for work, I thought I'd just walk into my office building and suddenly have a whole crew of buddies waiting for me. But it didn't quite pan out that way.I started by joining some online groups for people with similar interests – I'm a big fan of hiking, so I joined a local meetup group that organized hikes every weekend. It was a great way to get outside and meet new people in a relaxed setting. We'd go on these amazing hikes through the mountains, and then grab coffee or brunch afterwards.One guy I met there, Alex, turned out to be an old friend from high school who had also moved to the city. We reconnected over beers and started hanging out regularly. He introduced me to his friends, and before I knew it, we were having regular game nights and potluck dinners.My point is, don't try to force friendships – just put yourself out there in a low-pressure setting where you can be yourself. Whether it's a meetup group, a class, or even just a volunteer gig, find something that aligns with your passions and interests. And don't worry if it takes time – building genuine connections with people is like planting a garden: it needs time to grow.So, what's something you're passionate about? What would you like to try out?
