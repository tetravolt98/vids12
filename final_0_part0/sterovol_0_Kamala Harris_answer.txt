What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done in front of a crush?
    
The infamous incident with Alex Chen, my high school science project partner and the object of my secret admiration. It was a chilly autumn morning, and our class had been assigned to create a presentation on renewable energy sources for a science fair. I had spent hours researching and designing a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation, complete with animations and graphs.The day of the presentation arrived, and as we were setting up our display board, Alex accidentally knocked over my carefully crafted diagram, spilling markers and papers all over the floor. In a panic, I tried to quickly gather everything while Alex apologetically helped me clean up the mess.As we began to set up again, I realized that I had left my phone on silent mode in my backpack – but my phone was blasting the most embarrassing song ever: "I Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys. My classmates started snickering, and Alex, trying not to laugh, quickly whispered to me, "Dude, turn it off!" The worst part? My crush had already seen me awkwardly fumbling with my phone while I was trying to salvage my dignity.We managed to power through the presentation, but I couldn't shake the feeling that my momentary lapse in coordination and taste had sealed my fate as a science project reject. Little did I know, Alex would later reveal that he found it endearing – who knew?Now, that's a story for another time! What about you? Got any cringe-worthy moments to share?
