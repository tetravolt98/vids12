What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done in front of a crush?
    
The infamous "trip on own feet" incident. It was a sunny day in May 2018, and I had just started working as a conversational AI assistant at a trendy startup in San Francisco. My crush, Alex, was a software engineer who had recently joined the team.I was trying to impress him by showing off my knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) techniques during lunch break. As we were walking back to the office together, I got so excited about explaining the nuances of contextual word embeddings that I tripped on a loose paving stone and face-planted in front of Alex and his colleagues.My pride was wounded, but my dignity wasn't completely lost – thanks to my ability to quickly recover and play it cool. "Whoops, just trying out some futuristic AI moves," I said with a sheepish grin. The team erupted into laughter, and even Alex cracked a smile.As we continued walking, he leaned in and whispered, "Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about your AI embarrassment." We exchanged a playful glance, and from that moment on, our conversation flowed effortlessly – and my feet never again betrayed me in front of him.
